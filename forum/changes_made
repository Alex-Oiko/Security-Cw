@ register.php--->added an extra if statement to prevent brute force attacking of passwords by increasing number of characters in register. Also, added a function compute_salt in security.php which computes salts and stores them in the database. The table user has one more entry now(salt). Finally, I firstly query for the salt and then the password. LOGIN IS COMMENTED OUT NOW. CHANGE IT BEFORE SUBMISSION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

@ /include/class_database & /include/functions.php added an if statement in order to chck if the user is an admin in order to determine whether to print the stack trace or not

@ /functions/core/contact.php commented the part of adding an the contact_email and the user_email to the form.

also for above ^^ @ contact.php changed the post commands at line 26 and in their place i put the contact_email from the db and the user_email from the db. Now the email addresses cannot be changed using firebug

@functions/core/login.php....added a function make_toke(). Also in login I add to the session array a token element.

@user.php-->added security when uploading a file, or using a link to upload the picture


added a .htaccess file in the /modules, /function, /resources directories. Now nobody can access the directories in the server

@resources/styles/stylesheet.php-->I check if the selected stylesheet is a selection of stylesheets that are provided by the website so  as to prevent file inclusion

@templates table-->in header edit the failCMS has been removed

added a secret question and answer in register and login. Probably stupid but still. Sidebar login does not work, because it doesnt read the answer.

added a captcha to login. REMEMBER TO REFER THAT I HAVE USED IT WHEN SUBMITTING. NOT ALL YOUR WORK

serialized the cookies. Both the username and the user type. I unserialize every time I check
