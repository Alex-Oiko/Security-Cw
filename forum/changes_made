@ register.php--->added an extra if statement to prevent brute force attacking of passwords

@ /include/class_database & /include/functions.php added an if statement in order to chck if the user is an admin in order to determine whether to print the stack trace or not

@ /functions/core/contact.php commented the part of adding an the contact_email and the user_email to the form.

also for above ^^ @ contact.php changed the post commands at line 26 and in their place i put the contact_email from the db and the user_email from the db. Now the email addresses cannot be changed using firebug

@functions/core/login.php....added a function make_toke(). Also in login I add to the session array a token element.
